# Intelliproof

A React-based web application built with TypeScript and Vite.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/collective-intelligence-lab/intelliproof.git
   cd intelliproof
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a .env.local file in the root directory and add the following to it:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here

# API Configuration (optional - defaults to localhost:8000 for development)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

The application should now be running in development mode with hot-reload enabled, meaning any changes you make to the code will automatically update in the browser.

## Project Structure

```
intelliproof/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/               # Source code
â”œâ”€â”€ public/           # Static assets
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html        # Entry HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json      # Project dependencies and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json     # TypeScript configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.ts    # Vite configuration
â””â”€â”€ README.md         # Project documentation
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Starts the development server
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run preview` - Locally preview the production build

## Technologies Used

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

## API Configuration

The application uses a centralized configuration for API endpoints located in `src/lib/config.ts`. This allows for easy switching between development and production environments.

### Environment Variables

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Set this to your production API URL when deploying. If not set, it defaults to `http://localhost:8000` for development.

### Usage

All API calls now use the centralized configuration:

```typescript
import { API_URLS } from "../lib/config";

// Instead of hardcoded URLs like:
// fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/signup')

// Use the centralized configuration:
fetch(API_URLS.SIGNUP);
```

This makes it easy to switch between environments without modifying individual files.

Backend Server

Create a file named .env in the backend directory with the following content:

SUPABASE_URL = your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY = your_supabase_anon_key
JWT_SECRET_KEY = your_jwt_secret_key

cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload

TODO

1. Ensure that session data is stored to local storage on signup ( DONE )
2. Add team members section and photos to the lib
3. Secure access to the post-login pages (about, home, graph_editor)
4. Reseach DS and Algos needed to incorporate multi-user graph editors
5. Research policies and required triggers to secure the DB from unauthorized access

npm install @supabase/supabase-js formidable
npm install --save-dev @types/formidable

## Deployment

### Live Applications

- **Frontend**: [https://intelliproof.vercel.app](https://intelliproof.vercel.app)
- **Backend**: [https://intelliproofbackend.vercel.app](https://intelliproofbackend.vercel.app)

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

#### Prerequisites

- Vercel CLI installed: `npm install -g vercel`
- Vercel account connected

#### Environment Variables Required

Set these in your Vercel dashboard or via CLI:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://intelliproofbackend.vercel.app
```

#### Deploy Commands

```bash
# Login to Vercel (if not already logged in)
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Or deploy with environment variables inline
vercel --prod -e NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_url -e NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key -e NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://intelliproofbackend.vercel.app
```

### Backend Deployment (Vercel)

#### Prerequisites

- Vercel CLI installed
- Navigate to the `backend/` directory

#### Environment Variables Required

Set these in your Vercel dashboard for the backend project:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_for_token_signing
```

#### Deploy Commands

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Login to Vercel (if not already logged in)
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Or deploy with environment variables inline
vercel --prod -e SUPABASE_URL=your_url -e SUPABASE_KEY=your_key -e JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret
```

#### Backend Configuration

Ensure your `backend/vercel.json` is properly configured:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "main.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "main.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Important Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Always set environment variables in the Vercel dashboard for production deployments rather than committing them to your repository.

2. **CORS Configuration**: The backend is configured to accept requests from the frontend domain. If you change deployment URLs, update the CORS settings in the backend.

3. **Database**: Both frontend and backend connect to the same Supabase instance. Ensure your Supabase project is properly configured with the required tables and RLS policies.

4. **Redeploy**: Any changes to the codebase will require redeployment. Use `vercel --prod` in the respective directories to redeploy.

PUSH MONDAY 21 JULY 2025 BUG FIXES TO REMEMMBER

- automated check evidence and validate edge working reasonably well

  - need to test with actual arguments and see if output matches expected

* evidence scores after check_node_evidence and check_evidence are updating evidence scores
  appear amongst multiple nodes

* AI copilot buttons need to be parsed, remove redundant

  - remove "Validate Edge" as it is being run automatically after edge modification
  - Generate Assumptions not working
  - Validate All Edges valid ðŸ¤—

* messages need to be sot

TO WORK ON:

- Report Generation

QUESTIONS:

-- storage of messages neccessary?
-- purpose and domain of chatbox (AI custom messages)
-- broken record but ASSUMMPTIONS
-- edge clarification with Kabir
-- extra LLM keys to test with?
-- WAITING ON ARGUMENT YAML CONFIMATION FROM KAVEH FOR critique_graph(G)
-- WAITING ON propagation function FROM KAVEH

BUGS:

- critique graph -> yaml identification not showing
  -> messages could display more node/yaml info

- automated calls running when graph loaded?

  - I THink --> trigger credibility modifies nodes (via score update)

              --> each modified node triggers a check_evidence(call)
                          and this might change evidence scores

              --> each modified node triggers credibility again and so circular loop

???? WHERE U TESTING YOUR CREDIBILITTY FUNCTION WITH intelliproof@gmail.com missing scientist graph becuase when i did i was getting an infinite loop of credibility and check_evidence calls running forever. might have been my bug but I dont think it was.

- check if propagation BFS has a seen data structure to avoid re-processing nodes.

FRONTEND BUGS

- Graph Canvas Navbars overlap when both Evidence Navbar and AI Copilot navbar active

  --> open graphcanvas, pin the AI copilot and Evidence Navbars
  --> observe the Intelliproof toolbar and the graph save/crititque/report toolbar

- Inability to change edge from attatcking and supporting

  --> when u add an edge, it is impossible to switch from attack or support
  --> NOT SERIOUS : easier way to change direction after adding edge

  - Do we actually need the arrows that change edge from attatcking/defending
    --> maybe the toggler can be added to edge edit modal

- Unlink Evidence not working

  --> add evidence via the Edit Claim Modal, then try Unlink it
  --> Need to update Redux via useEffect or useState update

- Inability to delete evidence from evidence management section

BACKEND BUGS

- (DONE) argument_patterns_bank.yaml missing from the vercel deployment

      --> run critique graph on vercel deployment and see AI Copilot error and console

  FIX --> copy .yaml file from ../spec to intelliproof/backend/upload

-

- Report Generation

        --> runs check_all, might be easier to collect info from console instead
        --> Executive Summary Header overlapping with into section

        --> graph information needs to be re-referenced with frontend to get
            claim text, claim type, edge type, evidence text information

Features / bugs to fix:

### Debug Features / general features:

- Don't trigger validate all edges upon loading graph - (DONE)
- Trigger validate edge when claims are modified - (DONE)
- Remove any involvement of evidence in validate edge function - (DONE)
- Make sure save also saves the edge scores - (DONE)
- Make sure a 0 scored edge does not affect the score at all - (DONE)
- Walk through building 6 - 7 nodes, manually calculate score and compare with AI generated to ensure the calculation is as expected - (DONE)
- Evidence analysis / justification not updating when node is modified, only score gets updated - (DONE)
- Deleting a NODE that was connected to another node should re-trigger the automation for get claim cred. Right now if you delete the edge it does this, but not when u delete the node (which in turn deletes the edge) - (DONE)

- Swap target and source claim in validate edge function. - (DONE)
- Enter key should save content and trigger automation
  - ensure no other edge cases around this
- Enable drag and drop of evidence onto nodes -(DONE )
  - NOT ADDED -> need to click away and click again for modal to be updated...
- Make delete evidence / unlink evidence functional - (DONE)
  - Make it so that the moment you add / delete evidence the cred score is recalled, not when u deselect -> NOT DONE
- Style edge scores nicely
- Fix fonts / styling in ALL modals
- Graph Canvas Navbars overlap when both Evidence Navbar and AI Copilot navbar active
- Claim modal overlaps with top right navbar when expanded
- validate edge is re-triggering check evidence which is unnecessary (but only when I modify the right node, ie the node with an outgoing edge)
- deleting the left node is re-triggering check ev and get claim cred on right node, which is not needed
- loading an existing graph starts in a state that is too zoomed out
- when u load a graph, the analysis section in the evidence cards does not render, have to re-run check evidence to see it
- Make edge toggle functional (user can pick support / attack edge)
  - If AI returns a score that changes color, make sure the color change is reflected on graph
- Few shot learning for all prompts
- Center score within mini circle (increase font size slightly)
- remove buttons from copilot section
- in check node evidence, make the prompt emphasize that the AI should assess how well the "content" of the evidence supports the claim. because the title might support it but if the content is unrelated to the title I think right now it still scores it highly. Perhaps say just use the title as context but only analyze the content of the evidence.
- Move generate assumptions onto the edge modal
- Implement chat Q&A (With Kaveh help)
- Helper / info box explaining the different functionality / features of graph
- Position header section of nodes slightly more to left (there's a very small white gap)
- Extensive console logging throughout the process
  - change to be named console log, give it terminal like theme
- Format console output slightly nicer, can still be raw but change things like "confidence" to "score"
- Step-by-step progress tracking
- Error reporting and recovery
- Performance monitoring

IF there's TIME (low priority):

- Use get_node_cred instead of get_claim_cred (more efficient)
- Enable drag and drop of supporting docs onto nodes
- Reziseable nodes
- Potential layout locks, snap to a left - right layout format

TO DO:
