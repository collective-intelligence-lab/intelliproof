# Intelliproof

A React-based web application built with TypeScript and Vite.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/collective-intelligence-lab/intelliproof.git
   cd intelliproof
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
