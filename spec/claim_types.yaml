claim_types:
  - name: Factual
    description: Verifiable by observation or empirical data.

  - name: Value
    description: Expresses judgments, ethics, or aesthetics; cannot be verified empirically.

  - name: Policy
    description: Proposes actions or changes; includes normative statements like "should" or "must".

type_interactions:
  - from: Factual
    to: Factual
    interpretation: Typical deduction or induction.
    possible_issue: Check inference validity.

  - from: Factual
    to: Value
    interpretation: Attempts to derive value from fact.
    possible_issue: Risk of naturalistic fallacy — “It is” doesn’t imply “it is good.”

  - from: Factual
    to: Policy
    interpretation: Uses factual premise to justify normative action.
    possible_issue: Often misses normative warrant — why this fact justifies this policy.

  - from: Value
    to: Policy
    interpretation: Derives policy from ethical or moral premise.
    possible_issue: Relies on shared moral framework — risk of relativism or subjective bias.

  - from: Value
    to: Value
    interpretation: Ethical or aesthetic reasoning within a value system.
    possible_issue: May become circular or dogmatic — hard to verify or challenge.

  - from: Policy
    to: Policy
    interpretation: Strategic or comparative justification of policy.
    possible_issue: May be circular, vague, or ideologically inconsistent.

notes:
  - Graph edges should respect claim type compatibility.
  - A factual premise rarely justifies a value or policy conclusion without a hidden value-based assumption.
